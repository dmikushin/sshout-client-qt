# SSH-based chat room (client part in Qt)

This is a fork of "Secure Shout Host Oriented Unified Talk" by Rivoreo originally published on [sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/p/sshout).

The purpose of this program is to have a messenger program that works simply over the SSH protocol, without any additional dedicated third-party or self-hosted services.
